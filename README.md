# P4_Advanced_Lane_Lines_Detection
Created a new advanced Computer Vision based pipeline to tackle the problem of Lane Detection

## Advanced Lane Finding

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

In this project, the details of the solution strategies and programming pipelines are fully explained in the [writeup.md](./writeup.md) file. Please have a look at this file on how I approached to solving the problem of Lane Detection.
